This is a simple database project about a library system.
It has tables for courses, students, staff, books, and book issues.

I wrote some queries to:

See all the data in each table

Find students from a specific course or year

Search students by their ID

Check which students have fines

Show students in a year range

Arrange students, courses, and staff in order

This project helped me practice SQL and learn how to manage data in a library system.
